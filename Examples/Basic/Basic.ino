/*

 *
 * This is a basic demo of the seven segment library
 * that works will work with a single 7 segment display component
 *
 * It will turn on all display segments then turn them off 5 times,
 * count to 9, then display all the characters available.
 *
 * You will need to set your driver and your screen configuration in the line
 * screen.begin("AY0438","8");
